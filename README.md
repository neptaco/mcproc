## Overview

mcproc bridges the gap between AI agent development and traditional command-line workflows. It enables AI agents to manage long-running development processes (like dev servers, build watchers, etc.) while providing developers with full CLI access to monitor and control these same processes.

## Why mcproc?

Simple AI agent-launched processes are stateless and can't manage long-running processes effectively. mcproc solves this by:

- **Unified Control**: No more confusion about which agent or terminal is running what - all processes are centrally managed
- **Context Preservation**: Logs are captured and stored, allowing AI agents to debug issues while reviewing logs from earlier
- **Developer-Friendly**: Full CLI access means you're never locked out of your own development environment

## Key Features

- üîÑ **Unified Process Management**: Start and manage background processes from AI agents via MCP, then monitor them from your terminal
- üëÅÔ∏è **Cross-Environment Visibility**: Processes started by AI agents are fully accessible via CLI and other agents, and vice versa
- üìù **Intelligent Log Management**: Capture, persist, and search process logs with powerful regex patterns
- üìÅ **Project-Aware**: Automatically groups processes by project context
- üìä **Real-time Monitoring**: Follow logs in real-time from CLI while AI agents manage the processes
- üõ°Ô∏è **XDG Compliant**: Follows XDG Base Directory specification for proper file organization
- ‚ö° **Wait-for-Log**: Start processes and wait for specific log patterns to ensure readiness
- üîç **Advanced Search**: Time-based filtering, context lines, and regex support for log analysis
- üß∞ **Toolchain Support**: Execute commands through version managers (mise, asdf, nvm, rbenv, etc.)
- üßπ **Clean Command**: Stop all processes in a project with a single command
- üå≤ **Process Groups**: Automatic cleanup of child processes when stopping parent processes

## Installation

### Using Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
# Add the tap
brew tap neptaco/tap

# Install mcproc
brew install mcproc
```

### Build from source

#### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)
- protobuf compiler:
  - macOS: `brew install protobuf`
  - Linux: `apt-get install protobuf-compiler`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neptaco/mcproc.git
cd mcproc
cargo build --release

# Install to PATH (optional)
cargo install --path mcproc
```

## Usage

### Setup as MCP Server

After installing mcproc, you need to register it as an MCP server with your AI assistant.

#### For Claude Code

```bash
# Register mcproc as an MCP server
claude mcp add mcproc mcproc mcp serve
```

#### For Other MCP Clients

Configure your MCP client by adding mcproc to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcproc": {
      "command": "mcproc",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Tools

Once registered, AI agents can use these tools:

- `start_process`: Start a development server or background process
- `stop_process`: Stop a running process
- `restart_process`: Restart a process
- `list_processes`: List all running processes
- `get_process_logs`: Retrieve process logs
- `search_process_logs`: Search through process logs with pattern matching
- `get_process_status`: Get detailed process information

### For Developers (CLI)

While AI agents manage processes in the background, you can monitor and control them:

Recommended command: `mcproc logs -f`

#### Examples

```bash
# Start the daemon (if not already running)
mcproc daemon start

# View all processes (including those started by AI agents)
mcproc ps

# Follow logs in real-time
mcproc logs frontend -f

# Multi-process log streaming per project
mcproc logs -f

# Search through logs
mcproc grep backend "error" -C 5

# Stop a process
mcproc stop frontend
```

### Example Workflow

1. **AI agent starts your development server:**
   ```
   Agent: "I'll start the frontend dev server for you"
   ‚Üí Uses MCP tool: start_process(name: "frontend", cmd: "npm run dev", wait_for_log: "Server running")
   ```

2. **You monitor it from terminal:**
   ```bash
   mcproc logs -f
   # See real-time logs as the server runs
   ```

3. **AI agent detects an error and searches logs:**
   ```
   Agent: "Let me check what's causing that error"
   ‚Üí Uses MCP tool: search_process_logs(name: "frontend", pattern: "ERROR|WARN", last: "5m")
   ```

4. **You can see the same information:**
   ```bash
   mcproc grep frontend "ERROR|WARN" -C 3 --last 5m
   ```

### Advanced Examples

```bash
# Start a process with environment variables
mcproc start api --cmd "python app.py" --env PORT=8000 --env DEBUG=true

# Wait for a specific log pattern before considering the process ready
mcproc start web --cmd "npm run dev" --wait-for-log "Server running on" --wait-timeout 60

# Search logs with time filters
mcproc grep api "database.*connection" --since "14:30" --until "15:00"

# View logs from multiple processes in the same project
mcproc ps
mcproc logs web --project myapp -t 100

# Use version managers for Node.js projects
mcproc start web --cmd "npm run dev" --toolchain nvm
mcproc start api --cmd "yarn start" --toolchain mise

# Clean up all processes in a project
mcproc clean --project myapp

# Force stop all processes in current project
mcproc clean --force
```

## Architecture

mcproc consists of three main components:

1. **mcproc daemon**: A lightweight daemon that manages processes and handles log persistence
2. **mcproc CLI**: Command-line interface for developers to interact with the daemon
3. **MCP Server**: Exposes process management capabilities to AI agents via the Model Context Protocol

### File Locations (XDG Compliant)

- **Config**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcproc/config.toml` (defaults to `~/.config/mcproc/`)
- **Logs**: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/mcproc/log/` (defaults to `~/.local/state/mcproc/log/`)
- **Runtime**: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/mcproc/` (defaults to `/tmp/mcproc-$UID/`)
